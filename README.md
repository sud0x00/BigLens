 **BigLens is a reverse image search platform that utilizes online sources like Google, Bing, and Yandex to deliver accurate results. **


Our aim is to further enhance the capabilities of BigLens by incorporating computer vision to scale up its performance. We plan to implement something similar to Yandex's Sibir over time.
Join us on our journey to revolutionize the way people search for images on the internet.

**Introduction:** Reverse image search is a technique that allows a user to search for images based on the image itself, rather than text-based keywords. It works by analyzing the visual content of an image, and then comparing it to a database of indexed images. The search results will then be images that are visually similar to the input image. This technology is commonly used by search engines, such as Google Images, Bing Images, and TinEye, to help users quickly find the source of an image or to find similar images.
